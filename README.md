## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles

### What I learned

This work is my first time using Tailwindcss to this extent. There is still a lot more to learn about Tailwind.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about responsive design and changing default Tailwind settings. It would be fantastic to try Tailwind on a bigger project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Docs are always helpful.
